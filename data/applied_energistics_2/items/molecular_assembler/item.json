    "description": "The assembler is a powered machine which crafts items, it can be upgraded by inserting Acceleration Cards into it; once upgraded it is very fast.\n\nFunctions in one of two modes, single pattern mode or interface fed mode.\n\nSingle Pattern Mode\nUses a single Encoded Pattern (must be a crafting recipe) inserted into the assembler to craft an item without a crafting network.\n\nThis makes it useful in stand alone setups or in configurations where it can be fed by other mods and even chained together to to craft a final output. Items will be accepted from any side and exported into any available inventories.\n\nInterface Fed Mode\nUses the Encoded Patterns (must be a crafting recipe)  from attached ME Interface to craft items when they are requested by the Crafting CPU.\n\nNote, this mode requires that the assembler not contain a Encoded Pattern; the pattern slot must be empty."
