    "description": "High Speed Transition Track is used for transitioning from high speed track to medium speed track and medium speed track to low speed track.  They are most useful when entering a turn and can be used to safely avoid a crash. H.S. Transition Tracks can be used when transitioning from [[H.S. Track]] to other types of track such as [[Reinforced Rail]] and [[Rail]]s.\n\nWhen powered with a [[Redstone]] signal, this track will act as a booster, accelerating the [[Minecart]] or other type of transportation. When not powered with a Redstone signal, it will act as a brake, just as a Vanilla [[Powered Rail]] would do. This track is great when trying to make a safe turn or when entering a playerâ€™s station. \n\n### Effective Track Transitions\n\nTrack transitions are vital when a player wants to stop/start a High Speed line. Track transitions are achieved by first slowing the minecart or other transportation vehicle. Then, using unpowered [[H.S. Transition Track]] and then a strip of about 5 [[Reinforced Track]]s after the H.S. Track. This is to prevent the track breaking in the event of a explosion.\n\nSee also [[H.S. Track]] for a detailed description on crashes and making safe turns."
