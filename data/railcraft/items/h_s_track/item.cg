description: High Speed Track is used for fast travel in a straight line. Carts at high speed are not capable of making corners, so it is necessary to slow them down using [[H.S. Transition Track]]s or an unpowered [[H.S. Booster Track]], followed by a straight stretch of track 10-15m long and then use regular track for making the corner.  After the corner, you can to the reverse the get back up to speed.
