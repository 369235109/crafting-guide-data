    "description": "The Copper Chest takes up a single block but offers 5 rows of storage (as compared to 3 in a regular wooden [[Chest]]). That makes for 45 slots total capacity.\n\nIn addition to its regular crafting recipe, one can upgrade a regular wooden chest by right-clicking it with a [[Wood to Copper Chest Upgrade]].\n\nSimilarly, the Copper Chest can be upgraded to either an [[Iron Chest]] using the [[Copper to Iron Chest Upgrade]] or to a [[Silver Chest]] using the [[Copper to Silver Chest Upgrade]]."
