    "description": "The Diamond Chest takes up a single block but offers 12 rows of storage (as compared to 3 in a regular wooden [[Chest]]). That makes for 108 slots total capacity.\n\nIn addition to its regular crafting recipe, one can upgrade a [Gold Chest] by right-clicking it with a [[Gold to Diamond Chest Upgrade]].\n\nSimilarly, the Diamond Chest can be upgraded to either a [[Crystal Chest]] using the [[Diamond to Crystal Chest Upgrade]] or to an [[Obsidian Chest]] using the [[Diamond to Obsidian Chest Upgrade]]."
