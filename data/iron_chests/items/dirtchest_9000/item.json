    "description": "The Dirt Chest 9000! is a joke item.  With only room for one slot, it is considerably worse than any other option.\nHowever, should you make one and fill it with dirt, a humorous manual will be added to your inventory.\n\nThe DirtChest 9000! cannot be picked up through conventional means, making it useful on modded Factions severs, as the enemy has to waste time with something like a JABBA [[Dolly]] to move the walls of DirtChest 9000!s"
