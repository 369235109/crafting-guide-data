    "description": "The Gold Chest takes up a single block but offers 9 rows of storage (as compared to 3 in a regular wooden [[Chest]]). That makes for 81 slots total capacity.\n\nIn addition to its regular crafting recipe, one can upgrade an [[Iron Chest]] to a Gold Chest by right-clicking it with an [[Iron to Gold Chest Upgrade]].  You can also upgrade a [[Silver Chest]] by using a [[Silver to Gold Chest Upgrade]].\n\nThe Gold Chest can itself be upgraded to a [[Diamond Chest]] by using a [[Gold to Diamond Chest Upgrade]] on it."
