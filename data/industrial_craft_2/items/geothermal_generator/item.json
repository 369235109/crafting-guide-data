{"description":"Lava-bearing items are placed in the upper-left slot, and if empty containers are returned, they will appear in the lower-left slot. Lava will fill up to the 8000 mB internal storage capacity, shown in the center vertical gauge, and as the lava is consumed it will produce EU. This happens automatically, no need for a redstone signal.\nIf the generated EU is not being drawn off by a cable or adjacent machine, it will charge the internal storage up to 2.4K EU, shown by the horizontal gauge on the upper right. Power tier 1 items may be charged using the slot underneath. If the internal EU storage is completely full, no additional lava will be consumed; none is wasted."}
