{"description":"Single-Use Battery can store up to 1200 EU. That's 8800 EU less than their rechargeable counterparts, 400 EU more than plain Redstone, and you can't recharge them.\n\nA 64 stack of Single-Use Batteries contains 76.8k EU in a single inventory slot, much more space efficient then RE-Batteries (10k), and do not require a generator to be deployed on-site."}
