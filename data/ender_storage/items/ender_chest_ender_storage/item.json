    "description": "The Ender Chest is a storage block from EnderStorage which predates the vanilla [[Ender Chest]].\n\nEach chest has three wool pads on top that can be manipulated by right-clicking them with a dye.\n\nAll Ender Chests with the same 3-color code will access a shared inventory, no matter what dimension they are placed in. For example, a red-orange-yellow Ender Chest shares its inventory with all other red-orange-yellow Ender Chests, but cannot be accessed at a red-yellow-orange Ender Chest.\n\nWith the 16 different colored dyes of Minecraft, there are **4,096 possible 3-color codes**.\n\nAn [[Ender Pouch]] can be used to access the inventory of an Ender Chest from the player's hotbar wherever they are **if right click on the Ender Chest**\n\n**Multiple Ender Chest with the same code can accesses each other**.",
