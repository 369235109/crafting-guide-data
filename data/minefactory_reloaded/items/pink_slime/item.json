    "description": "Pink Slime is produced by the [[Slaughterhouse]] as it kills mobs. As a fluid, it can be piped out and stored in tanks, buckets or even just poured out into the world.  In the world, it can be drunk by a (foolish) player using a [[Straw]] to with the following effects:\n\n* Speed III 0:60\n* Hunger 0:10\n* Weakness 0:10\n* Nausea 0:25\n\nAs you can see, nasty stuff.  In fact, if left alone in the world for a few seconds, it will spawn a Pink Slime mob which will then proceed to attack the player.  When defeated, it will drop a few [[Pink Slimeball]]s (interchangable with regular [[Slimeball]]s).\n\nA more helpful use is to pipe the stuff into a [[Meat Packer]] where 100 mB will be converted into a [[Raw Meat Nugget]]\nwith can be cooked and consumed without ill effect.\n\nSee also: [[Meat Packer]], [[Raw Meat Nugget]], [[Slaughterhouse]], [[Straw]]"
