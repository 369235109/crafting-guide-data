    "description": "Sludge is a fluid produced by the [[Harvester]] as it brings in crops. As a fluid, it can be poured out into the world or piped into tanks, machines, etc. The best use for it is to pipe it into a [[Sludge Boiler]] where it can be converted into useful byproducts. However, if poured out into the world, it can have a number of nasty effects. If a player stands in a pool of sludge, the player will take damage every second and receive the following effects:\n\n* Weakness 0:11\n* Wither 0:11\n* Nausea 0:15\n\nAnd, should a player be so foolish as to drink it with a [[Straw]], the player will take 5 hearts of damage and receive\nthe following ill effects:\n\n* Wither 0:40\n* Nausea 0:40\n* Blindness 0:40\n\nSee also: [[Harvester]], [[Sludge Boiler]], [[Straw]]"
