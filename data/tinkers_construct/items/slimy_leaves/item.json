    "description": "Slimy Leaves are produced by the slime trees which grow from [[Slimy Sapling]]s.  The tree grows naturally on the floating \"slime islands\" added by Tinker's Construct.  By breaking the trunk of the tree (which is made of [[Congealed Green Slime]]), the leaves will disappear in the manner of normal leaves and drop [[Slimy Sapling]]s.  By using [[Shears]], the leaves can themselves be harvested."
