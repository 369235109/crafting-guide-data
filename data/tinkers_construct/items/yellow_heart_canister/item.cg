description: Like the [[Red Heart Canister]], the Yellow Heart Canister increases the player's maximum life by one heart (or 2 points).  Since you can only equip one of each color, you need a Yellow Heart Canister to get a second increase.  It is equipped using the extra inventory section added by Tinker's Construct.
