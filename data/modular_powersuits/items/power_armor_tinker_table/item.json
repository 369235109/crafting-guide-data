{"description":"The Power Armor Tinker Table is used to add modules to your Modular PowerSuit. With your armor pieces in your inventory (even equipped), just right-click the table to launch its GUI.  You can select the individual pieces of armor, and then click through the various modules which can be installed.  If you have the necessary input items in your inventory, you'll be able to add that module.  You can also configure modules you already have installed, create keybindings, and alter the appearance of your armor."}
