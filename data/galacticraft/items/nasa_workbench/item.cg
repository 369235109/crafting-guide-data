schema: 1

description: The NASA Workbench is where you create your space travel vehicles (i.e., rockets, the [[Buggy]], and [[Astro Miner]]).  When you first craft it, it only knows how to make a [[Rocket (Tier 1)]] and its cargo-carrying brethren.  In order to build more advanced vehicles, you'll need to find various schematics hidden in the dungeons of the planets you visit.
