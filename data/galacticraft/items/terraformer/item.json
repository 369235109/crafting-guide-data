    "description": "The Terraformer allows the transformation of a landscape from being infertile to being cultivable. It will create a large green bubble and slowly transform the superficial blocks, not the deeper ones, of the moon or planet into grass blocks.\n\nTo terraform the entire area within the bubble, the machine will require at least (may vary):\n- 2 water buckets;\n- 3 stacks of seeds;\n- 3 stacks of bone meal;\n- saplings (optional);\n- 10-12 MJ of energy."
