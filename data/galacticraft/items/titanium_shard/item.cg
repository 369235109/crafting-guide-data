description: The Titanium Shard is obtained by mining [[Ilmenite Ore]] found on asteroids.  It can be smelted into [[Titanium Ingot]]s, which can be further processed to make [[Compressed Titanium]] plates.  Smelting in an [[Electric Arc Furnace]] will double the number of ingots produced from each shard.
