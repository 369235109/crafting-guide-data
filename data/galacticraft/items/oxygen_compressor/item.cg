When supplied with oxygen via an [[Oxygen Pipe]], the Oxygen Compressor is capable of filling an oxygen tank (e.g., the [[Light Oxygen Tank]] or its large cousins).

Commonly, this unit will be paired with an [[Oxygen Collector]] and placed in the overworld to easily fill your oxygen tanks for travel on the surface of other planets.
