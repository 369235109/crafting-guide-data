    "description": "The Frequency Module allows you to hear sound on planets where you must wear a space suit (e.g., the Moon, Mars, etc.).  Without it, you will not be able to hear anything when wearing your space suit (e.g., your footfalls, approaching Creepers, ...).\n\nWhile you equip it along with your oxygen gear in the Galacticraft section of your inventory, it is actually completely optional, and your oxygen gear will work just fine without it."
