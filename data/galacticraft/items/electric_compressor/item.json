    "description": "The [[Electric Compressor]],is a machine block that is used to compress different kinds of ingots and convert them into compressed metal sheets and platings.\n\nIt has the same use as the non-electric [[Compressor]]. Its advantage is that it is not necessary to use coal or wood to power it. Instead it has to be powered with energy. "
