    "description": "The Oxygen Mask is one part of a complete space suit.  In order for it to be useful, you must place it in your character's Galacticraft inventory along with [[Oxygen Gear]] and at least one filled oxygen tank (e.g., the [[Light Oxygen Tank]])\n\nThe more oxygen you carry, the longer you'll be able to travel outside an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Two [[Heavy Oxygen Tank]]s will give you the most oxygen possible at something close to 15min of oxygen."
