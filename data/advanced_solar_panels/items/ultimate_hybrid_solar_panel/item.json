{"description":"Generate: 512 EU day, 64 EU night and rainy days.\n\nInternal storage: 1 000 000 EU\n\nOutput: 512 EU\n\nCharge slots: 4 (you can charge 4 electric things simultaneously)\n\n\n\nAfter many years of researches in the field of quantum physics our scientists have opened new properties of iridium. In a combination with the Sunnarium efficiency of transformation of solar energy, the resulting energy harvesting is increased 8 times!!! Using this new hybrid material we present our new model of the solar panel, with An energy output in day - 512 EU, at night and rainy days 64 EU!!! "}
