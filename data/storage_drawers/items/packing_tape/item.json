{"description":"Taped drawers will keep contents/upgrades when broken for easier relocation.\n\nA taped drawer is cut off from all player and machine interaction, like a stricter form of locking. You can't even see what's inside. A taped drawer will lose its tape automatically when placed back on the ground. It can also be removed by shift+right-clicking with an empty hand."}
