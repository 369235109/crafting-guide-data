{"description":"The conduit facade allows you to hide conduits behind a block. You can decide what the facade will look like by using a Painting Machine. The facade can be applied to a conduit by right clicking the facade onto the conduit. Conduit Facades will be hidden when the player is holding a wrench or a conduit.\n\nConduit facades can be reinforced with obsidian dust to give them protection against breaking and explosions."}
