{"description":"The advanced item filter is a more powerful version of the basic item filter. It functions similarly as the basic, but has 10 slots and additionally has options to ignore NBT data and to use the Ore Dictionary.\n\nThe basic item filter is used by placing in the matching upgrade slot of an Item Conduit's face GUI. This gives access to 5 different item filter slots. The filter can be set to whitelist or blacklist these items, and can be set to ignore or respect item metadata."}
