{"description":"A dimensional transceiver can transport items, fluids, power across any distance between dimensions.\n\nTo use the Dimensional Transceiver, you must of course have two of them. Then, create a channel by typing in a name in the top box (see GUI) and save it by hitting the plus. Whether the channel is public or private can be changed with the lock button. To use the created channel, select it in the appropriate list and hit the check mark, to disable a selected channel, hit the X. To connect to any amount of other Transceivers, simply set them to the same channel.\n\nThe Dimensional Transceiver has an internal buffer storage of 25,000 MJs, and can send 100MJ/t, or more depending on certain conditions (unsure of specifics at this time). It can be connected directly to power sources, such as Stirling Generators and Capacitor Banks, or Energy Conduits."}
