{"description":"The Angel Block is a block added by the Extra Utilities mod. This block is unique in that it does not need another block for it to be built against, so it can be placed in mid-air. When right-clicking the block will be placed in the direction you're looking. The block can't be placed diagonally in mid-air. No tool is required to break the block and it is broken instantly, even without any tools. After breaking the block does not drop, but rather instantly returns to the player's inventory."}
