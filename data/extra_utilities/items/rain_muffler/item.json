{"description":"The Rain Muffler is a block from Extra Utilities and an upgraded version of the Sound Muffler. It will silence any rain sounds in a radius of 64 blocks. The Rain Muffler will not activate instantly, as it takes a few seconds for already playing rain sounds to finish.\n\nThe player can also right-click the block while empty-handed to silence rain for themselves, regardless of the block being present nearby. Right-clicking the block undoes this, letting the player hear rain again."}
