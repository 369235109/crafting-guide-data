{"description":"Golden Spike is a block added by the Extra Utilities mod. It damages mobs that touch any side of it other than the bottom. With +4 attack damage, the Spike does as much damage as a Golden Sword. Mobs will not walk around the block, but will try to walk over it as if it were a regular solid block. Most explosions won't destroy the Spike because it has a very high blast resistance."}
