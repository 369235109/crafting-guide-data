{"description":"The Wooden Spike is a block added by the Extra Utilities mod.\n\nA defensive weapon that deals damage to any Mob or Player that touches it. A half-heart of damage will be repeatedly inflicted until only a half-heart of health remains; the mob or player will not be killed. The Wooden Spike can be placed on any of the six sides of a block and does not break if the block that it was placed on is removed. A Wooden Spike placed facing upwards may allow a mob traversing it to increase its elevation until it can access an adjacent two block high level. The Wooden Spike will not destroy dropped items."}
