    "description": "Ender-Lily Seeds, when planted on [[Dirt]], [[Grass]], or [[End Stone]] will grow into an Ender Lily.  After a certain stage of growth, dangerous spikes emerge (similar to a cactus).  When fully mature, the plant can be harvested to produce a single [[Ender Pearl]].  They grow immensely slowly on dirt or grass, but will take nearly a full Minecraft day even on end stone.\n\nWhen harvested, the plants will always yield at least one seed in addition to the Ender Pearl.  In extremely rare cases, a second seed will be produced.\n\nThe plants are generally compatible with harvesting machines from other mods, so it is possible to produce a fully automated Ender Pearl farm with them.\n\nThe seeds can either be obtained from Ender Lilies growing in The End, or as a rare bit of loot from dungeon and stronghold chests."
