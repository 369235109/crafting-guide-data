{"description":"The Sound Muffler is a block from Extra Utilities that will reduce the volume of most sounds in an 8 block radius (7 in ExU2) by 90 %. This can, for example, be used to quiet down farms with many animals.\n\nIt only works on sounds with a location, so music from the game or Jukeboxes will not be muffled. Muffled sounds will give off a small smoke particle traveling slightly in the direction of the block that muffled them."}
