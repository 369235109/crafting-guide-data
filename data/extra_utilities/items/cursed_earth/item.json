{"description":"Cursed Earth is a block created by the activation ritual for the Division Sigil. Digging up this block will yield only Dirt, unless a tool with Silk Touch is used. There is no crafting recipe available and Cursed Earth can only be obtained by performing the activation ritual and then using a Silk Touch tool.\n\nWhen directly exposed to sunlight, Cursed Earth will catch fire and revert to Dirt. This fire will in turn cause other nearby Cursed Earth to burn in a chain reaction. On the other hand, if it is dark, Cursed Earth will spread to nearby Dirt or Grass, in a similar manner to Grass.\n\nWhen exposed to high light levels from a non-sunlight source, Cursed Earth will stop spawning mobs, allowing you to easily toggle the spawning ability on and off by using some kind of toggle-able light source such as a vanilla Redstone Lamp. Note that any mob that moves over cursed earth in a light level of 10 or higher will lose health (players remain unharmed). While standing still, mobs will not take damage, unless they are being pushed or pulled around by other mobs, a player or a device."}
