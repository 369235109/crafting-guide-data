{"description":"Diamond Spike is a block added by the Extra Utilities mod. It damages mobs that touch any side of it other than the bottom. With +7 attack damage, the Spike does as much damage as a Diamond Sword. Mobs will not walk around the block, but will try to walk over it as if it were a regular solid block. Most explosions won't destroy the Spike because it has a very high blast resistance.\n\nThese can also be enchanted with all the enchantments a regular diamond sword would receive. This includes looting which functions exactly as it does on a sword. Interestingly, mobs killed by the Diamond Spike will return experience as if killed by the player."}
