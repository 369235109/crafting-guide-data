description: The QED (sometimes named the "Quantum Entanglement Diviner", but sometimes not) functions rather like an ender-powered crafting table.  Just set up a least one [[Ender-Flux Crystal]] nearby to provide ender energy, and place all the materials on the table.  After enough ender energy has been accumulated (faster the more crystals you have), the item will be produced.
