{"description":"The Ender Pearl can be obtained as a common drop from Endermen.  In vanilla Minecraft, it has two uses.  When thrown, it will teleport the player to the place where the pearl landed for the cost of a small amount of damage.  The second use is to craft them together with [[Blaze Powder]] to make an [[Eye of Ender]], which is used in getting to The End.\n\nMany mods also use Ender Pearls as crafting ingredients for items which have to do with teleportation or force fields.  So much so, in fact, that you may find that yourself making a trip to The End just to be able to collect enough of them!"}
