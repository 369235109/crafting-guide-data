The bowl is an item used for making mushroom soup.  This can either be done by a crafting recipe (see: [[Mushroom Soup]]) or by right-clicking a Mooshroom with the bowl in hand.

While both bowls and mushroom stack, soup does not.  So, it's wise to carry mushrooms and bowls separately and only make soup when needed.
