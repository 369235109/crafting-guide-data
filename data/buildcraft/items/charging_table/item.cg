The charging table transfers energy provided by lasers into an item capable of holding charge (e.g., a
[Redstone Flux Capacitor]).  It works much like an [Assembly Table] in that it requires powered [Laser]s within range to
provide it with power.  Just place an item in table, and it will automatically start the lasers and charge the item.
