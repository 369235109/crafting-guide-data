description: The stone fluid pipe is the second tier of ordinary fluid pipe.  With its transfer rate of 20mB/t, it is twice as fast as the [[Cobblestone Fluid Pipe]] (10mB/t), but considerably slower than the [[Golden Fluid Pipe]] (80mB/t).  The stone fluid pipe will connect to inventories and itself, but not to cobblestone or [[Quartz Fluid Pipe]]s.
