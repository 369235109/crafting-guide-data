description: The Diamond Gate is used to craft all other gates of its tier, can interact with any kind of pipe wire, and has eight "if" statement slots, as well as interaction with lots of inventories / tanks. NOTE: This item is crafted inside the Assembly Table, which requires lasers to receive RF energy, as it does NOT get RF on its own.
