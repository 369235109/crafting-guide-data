    "description": "Oil is a naturally-occuring liquid added by BuildCraft. While it can be burned in a [[Combustion Engine]] to produce\n30RF/t, it is much more adventageous to convert it to [[Fuel]] using a [[Refinery]] as fuel both produces more power\nper tick and burns longer.\n\nWhile not particularly common, Oil can be found in large spouts in ocean, desert, and swamp biomes. The spouts come in\ndifferent sizes, with the larger above-ground portion indicating larger oil deposits below ground. Each spout can\nproduce hundreds or even thousands of buckets of oil. The best way to remove oil is to use a [[Pump]] to extract it, and then convert it directly into [[Fuel]].\n\nSee also: [[Combustion Engine]], [[Fuel]], [[Refinery]]"
