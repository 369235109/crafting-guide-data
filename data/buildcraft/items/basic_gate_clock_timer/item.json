    "description": "This gate is an enhanced version of the Basic Gate, meaning it has an enhancement added to the normal capabilities of the Basic Gate. The Clock Timer functionality allows this gate to do a certain thing after a configurable amount of time passes. NOTE: This item is crafted inside the Integration Table, which requires lasers to receive RF energy, as it does NOT get RF on its own."
