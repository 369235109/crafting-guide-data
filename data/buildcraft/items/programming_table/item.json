    "description": "The Programming table is used to transform a plain [[Redstone Board]] into one specifically programmed for a certain kind of [[Robot]].  It operates using [[Laser]]s, so you will need to have a few nearby to power it.\n\n| ![](laser-and-table.png) |\n|--------------------------|\n\nTo create a specific board, right-click the table and pop a plain [[Redstone Board]] into the top-right slot.  Then, choose the type of board you want. Assuming your lasers and powered, you'll see the power meter on the far right climb as the energy is transferred.\n\n| ![](programming-table-gui.png) |\n|--------------------------------|\n"
